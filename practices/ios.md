# iOS

- Follow the [Ray Wenderlich Styleguide](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide) except using 2 spaces as indentation. We'll use 4 spaces as recommended by Apple.
- Prefer [realm.io](http://realm.io) over CoreData.
- Use CocoaPods whenever available. When you need a library/plugin, check [Cocoa Controls](https://www.cocoacontrols.com/) first before trying to do it yourself.
