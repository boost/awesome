# General practices

This is a list of things to prefer and avoid in projects. These practices are a result of trials-and-errors across many [Boost](http://boost.co.nz) projects. We've learned what works and what doesn't, and these are the lessons that stuck.

### Ethics
- Always be online on Slack.
- Conserve energy. Do not overwork yourselves.
- Do your best not to be a blocker to your teammates.
- Code clarity. Readable code, Yard docs and tested code.
