### Our practices
This is a list of things to prefer and avoid in projects. These practices are a result of trials-and-errors across many [Boost] projects. We've learned what works and what doesn't, and these are the lessons that stuck.

- [General practices](practices/) - ethics, new projects
- [Design](practices/design.md) - UI design and CSS
- [Git](practices/git.md) - Git and GitHub
- [JavaScript](practices/javascript.md) - Frontend and Node.js code
- [Rails](practices/rails.md) - Makes the world go 'round
- [Testing](practices/testing.md) - Detailed Rspec and TDD practices
- [iOS](practices/ios.md) - Xcode Swift development
